## REGENIE Association Testing. 

We highly recommend that interested users check out the excellent REGENIE documentation on their website before evaluating our association testing pipeline: https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/. 

### Code

Scripts `01`-`04` are concerned with preprocessing the necessary files to run REGENIE, including the imputed gene expression in UKB and genotypes to control for population stratification.
