##Code

Scripts `01a` and `01b` are scripts to apply our exclusion and inclusion criteria for UKB samples. `02` creates phenotype and covariate files for these samples, and `03` cleans these phenotypes. 

`04` adjusts phenotypes for covariates before association testing. Residuals from a linear model are inverse normalized, as described in Methods.
