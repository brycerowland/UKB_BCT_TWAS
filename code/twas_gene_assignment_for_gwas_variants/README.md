# Code
This directory contains the files for the BLUEPRINT enrichment comparison between TWAS genes and coloc genes. `01`-`02` are preprocessing and exploratory analysis files. `03` tests if TWAS gene assignments are more enriched for BLUEPRINT genes than coloc assignments for variants that are assigned genes by both methods. 

The `soranzo_group_results` subdirectory contains the OpenTargets analysis in the `soranzo_group_results/results_plot.R` script.
